**Components of a Workshop Proposal**

*Title of the session*
Introduction to Ecological Network Analysis

*Description of the session (appears online only; 250 words max.)*
Network analysis is a useful approach for studying complex ecological interactions: such as those that occur among genes, biochemicals, individuals, or species). This has lead to the rapid influx of network analytical and modeling tools in ecology. This workshop will guide attendees through the basics of network theory and several common applications of it in ecology. First, the organizers will present the underpinning network theory relevant to ecological analyses and models. Next, three sessions comprised of a combination of lecture and hands-on analyses will cover three often used network modeling approaches: bipartite, food web and biogeochemical cycling networks. Last, attendees will learn how to conduct dynamic simulations using a network approach.

- Introduce network theory and modeling (Stuart)
- Bipartite networks (mutualistic and trophic, Matt)
- Ecosystem networks (food webs, Caner)
- Ecosystem network analysis with enaR (BGC models, Stuart)
- Dynamic network simulations with EcoNet (Caner)

*Summary sentence (appears in print only; 50 word max.)*
This workshop will introduce ecologists to systems thinking and network analysis through: 1) an interactive overview of systems and network theory in ecology and 2) a hands-on training session for ecosystem network modeling and analysis using enaR and EcoNet.

*Minimum and maximum number of participants*
10-25

*Requested scheduling:*
Saturday or Sunday afternoon (12:00 – 5:00 PM; 5 hours)
Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday evening (8 – 10 pm; 2 hours)

*Setup*
The standard A/V setup is a screen, LCD projector, and laptop. Any additional A/V equipment must be requested in the proposal and may incur additional fees. Additional equipment includes internet connectivity, speakers for sound, portable microphones,  flip charts, easel poster boards, and extra power strips for participant laptops.

Room set-up desired: theater, conference, hollow square, rounds, other. 

In order to give priority to paper sessions, it is unlikely we will be able to provide room setups other than theater style for the weekday lunchtime (11:30 AM – 1:15 PM) workshop time slots. The weekend and evening time slots are typically more flexible in regard to room setup options.

Food and beverage requests. Note: Ordering food will add to registration costs.

If applicable, underwriting of workshop costs by a group or agency. Include contact information and the amount to be contributed.

Is the session intended to be linked to a scientific session? If so, which one, and how?
