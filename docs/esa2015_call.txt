**Application for ESA Workshop, August 2015**

-----------
--Outline--
-----------
[? prep and help getting computers setup]
[1 hour] Introduction to modeling and Network Theory (Establishing context)
(Stuart, Bernie, Stuart)
[1 hour] Food webs and ecosystem models: ENA and NEA (Stuart & Caner)
[1 hour] Bipartite Networks (Matt)
[1 hour] EcoNet: Dynamic simulation, NPT and NFD (Caner)
[+1 hour for questions, breaks and unstructured learning]

----------
---Prep---
----------
- Installing R and loading packages
- Readings suggested for each section
- Software best practices

-------------
--Food Webs--
-------------
[15 min] Basics of food webs
[15 min] Intro to some ENA metrics
[30 min] Using enaR to analyze ecosystem networks

-------------
--Bipartite--
-------------
[15 min] Bipartite graph: basic structure and ecology
[15 min] Metrics: nestedness, modularity and null models
[30 min] Bipartite package and example analysis

------------
---EcoNet---
------------
[15 mins] EcoNet presentation and demonstration.
[20 mins] EcoNet demonstration, and integration to other platforms
(enaR). Should not take more given that the results (ENA properties)
are discussed earlier.
[15 mins] Network Particle Tracking (NPT). After an EcoNet run, users
can choose to run NPT online, which provides a pathway for all
particles (based on the flow currency, particles represent C, N, P
atoms or energy quanta). We have the module ready, to be integrated in
EcoNet. 
[10 mins] Network Flux Decomposition (NFD). It is a decent way to
decompose a network into its functioning pieces. It is already
integrated into the test version (
http://eco.engr.uga.edu/index_test.html ).

*Title of the session*
Ecological Network Analysis

*Description of the session (appears online only; 250 words max.)*

Network analysis is a useful approach for studying complex ecological
interactions: such as those that occur among genes, biochemicals,
individuals, or species). This has lead to the rapid influx of network
analytical and modeling tools in ecology. This workshop will guide
attendees through the basics of network theory and several common
applications of it in ecology. By the end, attendees will be able to:
1.) Describe the core features of a network model, the variety in
ecology, and identify the data required to build one, 2.) explain what
kinds of ecological questions they can be used to address and 3.) use
software tools to perform selected ecological network
analysis. Beginning with and introduction to the underpinning network
theory the workshop will cover both structural and dynamic ecological
network analyses focusing on three common ecological networks,
mutualistic networks, food webs and ecosystem networks.


*Summary sentence (appears in print only; 50 word max.)* 

This workshop will introduce attendees to network ecology and analysis
through: 1) an interactive overview of network theory and 2) a
hands-on training session for ecological network modeling, analysis
and dynamic simulation using freely available software: bipartite,
enaR and EcoNet.
