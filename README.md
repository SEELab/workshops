ENA Workshops
=============


ESA 2015: Ecological Network Analysis (WK25)

12 - 12:10 — Introductions (Lau)
12:15 - 1 pm — Intro to Network (Borrett)
1 - 1:30 pm — Model Construction — with emphasis on ecosystem models.

1:30 - 1:45 — Break 1 — (Lau and Borrett help any students who need it
get R and enaR and bipartite and iGraph installed — hopefully we get
them to do this before the meeting).

1:45 - 2:45 — Bipartite Network Analysis [with R] (Lau)  — mutualistic
networks and more.  include ~10 intro to R.

2:45 - 3:00 pm — Break 2 — I am advocating for a second break to let
people catch their breath.

3:00 - 3:50 pm — Intro to ENA with enaR (Borrett, Lau, and Whipple). —
key will be to overview major concepts and select a couple to
implement (I suggest Flow - {Throughflow (centrality), FCI, I/D),
Environs -{TET centrality, micro analysis}, Utility Analysis);  I am
adding whipple to this group as I appreciate his offer to help the
students interpret the results.  I think this is essential.

4:00 - 4:50 pm — EcoNet — ENA, Dynamic Models, other new
analyses. (Caner)

4:50 - 5 pm — Summary and Wrap up.  (Lau).  — I think its critical to
remind them about what they learned and where they can get more
information.
