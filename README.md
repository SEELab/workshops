Ecologican Network Analysis
===========================


With interactions at its core, either among organisms or between organisms and abiotic factors, ecology is inherently a relational science. Because of this, ecological systems are very naturally and effectively approached using network analysis.

Exploring the range of ecological networks from the interactions among plants and pollinating insects to marine food-webs, this workshop will introduce the basics of network theory and introduce users through hands-on exercises to multiple tools for conducting network analysis.
