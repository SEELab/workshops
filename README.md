ENA Workshops
=============


ESA 2015: Ecological Network Analysis (WK25)

12 - 12:10 — Introductions (Lau)
12:15 - 1 pm — Intro to Network (Borrett)
1 - 1:30 pm — Model Construction — with emphasis on ecosystem models.

1:35 - 1:50 — Break 1 — (Lau and Borrett help any students who need it
get R and enaR and bipartite and iGraph installed — hopefully we get
them to do this before the meeting).

2:00 - 2:50 — Bipartite Network Analysis [with R] (Lau)  — mutualistic
networks and more.  include ~10 intro to R.

2:50 - 3:05 pm — Break 2 — I am advocating for a second break to let
people catch their breath.

3:25 - 4:25 pm — Intro to ENA with enaR (Borrett, Lau, and Whipple). —
key will be to overview major concepts and select a couple to
implement (I suggest Flow - {Throughflow (centrality), FCI, I/D),
Environs -{TET centrality, micro analysis}, Utility Analysis);  I am
adding whipple to this group as I appreciate his offer to help the
students interpret the results.  I think this is essential.

4:30 - 5:30 pm — EcoNet — ENA, Dynamic Models, other new
analyses. (Caner)

4:50 - 5 pm — Summary and Wrap up.  (Lau).  — I think its critical to
remind them about what they learned and where they can get more
information.


 One way to illustrate this issue is to review the Wikipedia entry on
 ecological networks
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_network). Our Ecosystem
 Network Modeling and Analysis is NOT represented on the page (which
 perhaps we should correct).



(4) Matt — if we can communicate with the participants ahead of time,
it would be helpful to know how many of them have experience with R.
It would also be interesting to ask them about their motivation to
join this workshop.  What do they want to know?

(5) If you were going to select 2-3 papers for the students to read
before the workshop, what would they be?  I will get these posted on
my website ASAP.
