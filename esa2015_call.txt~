**Application for ESA Workshop, August 2015**

I wonder if we should modify the description paragraph to
make it clear that we will spend ~1/3-1/2 the time on ecosystem
networks, as an example network analysis.  I would hate for everyone
to show up thinking about community food webs or social-behavioral
graphs and leave frustrated.  However, I do think we need to consider
other kinds of analyses broadly so that we have a sufficient audience.

As I mentioned, one of the things I think we need to do is to be clear
about the learning objectives/outcomes (SLO’s in academic jargon).
Here are 3 candidates:

At the end of the workshop, attendees should be able to ...


Audience:  I think our target audience is primarily graduate students
and postdocs.  We might also be of interest to early career
scientists, but I don’t expect this to be our primary audience.

Assumptions:  Everyone will bring their own computer.  We will provide
instructions for installing R and toolboxes prior to the workshop.
Perhaps we could meet an hour earlier with folks needing help.  I
think we also need to assume little to know programming experience and
probably little exposure to modeling.  Again, we might need to state
this in our descriptive paragraph.

*Title of the session*
Ecological Network Analysis

*Description of the session (appears online only; 250 words max.)*
Network analysis is a useful approach for studying complex ecological
interactions: such as those that occur among genes, biochemicals,
individuals, or species). This has lead to the rapid influx of network
analytical and modeling tools in ecology. This workshop will guide
attendees through the basics of network theory and several common
applications of it in ecology. By the end, attendees will be able to:
1.) Describe the core features of a network model, the variety in
ecology, and identify the data required to build one, 2.) explain what
kinds of ecological questions they can be used to address and 3.) use
software tools to perform selected ecological network
analysis. Beginning with and introduction to the underpinning network
theory the workshop will cover both structural and dynamic ecological
network analyses focusing on three common ecological networks,
mutualistic networks, food webs and ecosystem networks.


*Summary sentence (appears in print only; 50 word max.)*
This workshop will introduce attendees to network ecology and analysis through: 1) an interactive overview of network theory and 2) a hands-on training session for ecological network modeling, analysis and dynamic simulation using freely available software: bipartite, enaR and EcoNet.
